# Full-Stack-Energy-Simulation Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The **Full-Stack-Energy-Simulation** application provides a user-friendly platform for simulating and analyzing building energy consumption based on customizable parameters. The application is designed for energy consultants, architects, and facility managers to assess HVAC efficiency, building size, and insulation factors, enabling informed decisions for energy optimization.

### 1.2 Scope
This web-based application will:
- Allow users to input building parameters (e.g., size, HVAC specs, insulation, etc.).
- Calculate and display energy usage based on these parameters.
- Save simulation results in an **Oracle 23c AI database** for future reference.
- Provide a responsive and visually appealing UI for real-time and historical data visualization.
- Enable interaction via **REST APIs** to support extensibility.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **HVAC**: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning.  
- **REST API**: Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.  
- **Oracle 23c AI**: A relational database with AI-enabled capabilities.  
- **Frontend**: React.js.  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
